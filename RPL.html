            Open set recognition is an emerging research area that aims
            to simultaneously classify samples from predefined classes and identify
            the rest as ’unknown’. In this process, one of the key challenges is to
            reduce the risk of generalizing the inherent characteristics of numerous
            unknown samples learned from a small amount of known data. In this
            paper, we propose a new concept, Reciprocal Point, which is the potential representation of the extra-class space corresponding to each known
            category. The sample can be classified to known or unknown by the
            otherness with reciprocal points. To tackle the open set problem, we offer a novel open space risk regularization term. Based on the bounded
            space constructed by reciprocal points, the risk of unknown is reduced
            through multi-category interaction. The novel learning framework called
            Reciprocal Point Learning (RPL), which can indirectly introduce the
            unknown information into the learner with only known classes, so as to
            learn more compact and discriminative representations. Moreover, we
            further construct a new large-scale challenging aircraft dataset for open
            set recognition: Aircraft 300 (Air-300). Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets indicate that our framework is significantly
            superior to other existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard open set benchmarks.

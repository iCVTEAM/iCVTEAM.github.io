            Image-based salient object detection has made great
            progress over the past decades, especially after the revival of
            deep neural networks. By the aid of attention mechanisms to
            weight the image features adaptively, recent advanced deep
            learning-based models encourage the predicted results to 
            approximate the ground-truth masks with as large predictable
            areas as possible, thus achieving the state-of-the-art performance.
            However, these methods do not pay enough attention to small
            areas prone to misprediction. In this way, it is still tough to
            accurately locate salient objects due to the existence of regions
            with indistinguishable foreground and background and regions
            with complex or fine structures. To address these problems, we
            propose a novel convolutional neural network with purificatory
            mechanism and structural similarity loss. Specifically, in order
            to better locate preliminary salient objects, we first introduce
            the promotion attention, which is based on spatial and channel
            attention mechanisms to promote attention to salient regions.
            Subsequently, for the purpose of restoring the indistinguishable
            regions that can be regarded as error-prone regions of one model,
            we propose the rectification attention, which is learned from the
            areas of wrong prediction and guide the network to focus on
            error-prone regions thus rectifying errors. Through these two
            attentions, we use the Purificatory Mechanism to impose strict
            weights with different regions of the whole salient objects and
            purify results from hard-to-distinguish regions, thus accurately
            predicting the locations and details of salient objects. In addition
            to paying different attention to these hard-to-distinguish regions,
            we also consider the structural constraints on complex regions
            and propose the Structural Similarity Loss. The proposed loss
            models the region-level pair-wise relationship between regions
            to assist these regions to calibrate their own saliency values. In
            experiments, the proposed purificatory mechanism and structural
            similarity loss can both effectively improve the performance, and
            the proposed approach outperforms 19 state-of-the-art methods
            on six datasets with a notable margin. Also, the proposed method
            is efficient and runs at over 27FPS on a single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU.
